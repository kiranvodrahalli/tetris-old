I made this Tetris game as a sophomore in high school
for my Computer Science AB class. I run it as a shell
command on my computer. I might tweak it now and then
/ improve it. Have fun! :)

Note: Just add this to your .bash_profile to run it 
from anywhere on your computer:

function tetris() {
	  cd your_directory_here
			java Tetris
				cd -
}
